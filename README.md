Many years have passed since the Cataclysm, and the world has decayed as a result.
But one day the legendary Tower of Babel appeared, with rumors spreading that it had whatever you desire at the top, should you reach it.
Many tried to ascend it seeking fame, fortune, power, even love. These ambitious people were dubbed â€œAscendantsâ€ as a result.
You play as The Last Ascendant, one who managed to get to the top of the Tower.
Waiting for him was The Unspoken, a god-like entity who judged The Last Ascendant unworthy for his desired prize and cast him down to the First Floor.
Since he lost his legendary gear on the way down, he has to start from the ground up. Literally.
Now you have to fight the Scattered and other monsters as you climb back up the Tower with the goal of claiming what you have earned, with interest. 
The player will be challenged by the Scattered, corrupted Ascendants who wonâ€™t let anybody get what they themselves no longer can.
The Scattered are accompanied by the original monsters who inhabited the Tower when it first appeared.
Should you perish, you will be sent back to the ground level along with your artifacts being lost in the process.
As you progress through the floors, you will find artifacts to enhance your combat capabilities and get stronger.
Fight through the Scattered to reach the top once more to challenge The Unspoken and claim whatâ€™s rightfully yours!
